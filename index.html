                                <p>The Internet is a network made up of hundreds of millions of interconected devices referred to as
																<strong>hosts</strong> (also referred to as <strong>end-systems</strong>.)
																They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet, and they are referred to as hosts because
																they host applications such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, or an e-mail server program.</p>

																<p><strong>End-systems</strong> are connected by <strong>communication links</strong> (physical media like coaxil cable,
																copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrums) and <a href="#" onclick="$('#section-3').animatescroll();"><strong>packet-switches.</strong></a></p>

																<p>The <strong>access network</strong> is the network that physically connects an end-system to <strong>the first router</strong>
																	(aka <strong>the edge router</strong>) on the path from the end system to any distant system. </p>

															<h1>Packet Switches</h1>

															<p>When one end-system has to send data to another end-system, the sending system segments the data and adds <strong>header bytes</strong>
																 to each segment. The resulting packages of information (packets) are sent through the network to the end system,
															 where they are reassembled into the original data.</p>

															 <p>The header of each packet contains the IP address. This works like a postal system. A packet arrives at a router in the network and the
																 router, the router examines a portion of the packet's destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router. It does this with
																 the use of a <strong>forwarding table</strong> that maps portions of the desination address to one of that router's outbound links.<br>
															 The Internet has a number of special <strong> routing protocols</strong> that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables.</p>



																<p>A <strong>packet switch</strong> takes a package that's arriving into an incoming communication link, and forwards it
																to an outgoing communication link.</p>

																<p>The two most prominent types of packet switches are <strong> routers </strong> and <strong> link-layer switches</strong>.</p>

																<p>Routers are typically used in the network's <strong>core.</strong> </p>

																<p>Link-layer switches are typically used to <strong>access networks</strong>. </p>

																<p>The series of communication links and package switches that a packet goes through on its way from a sending
																	to recieving system is typically called a <strong>route</strong> or <strong>path</strong>.</p>

																	<p>Packages are transmitted to each communication link at <strong>a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link</strong>.
																		So if a source end-system or packet-switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with a transmission rate of
																		R bits/sec, then the time to trasmit the package is L/R seconds. </p>

																		<p>Most packet switches use <strong>store-and-forward transmission</strong> at the inputs to the link. This means that the
																			packet-switch <strong>must receive the entire packet</strong> before it can begin to <strong>transfer the first bit of the packet into
																			the outbound link</strong>.</p>

																			<p> Now, let's calculate the time that a system using the store-and-forward method needs to forward three packets
																				from a source, to a router, to a destination.<br>
																				<ul>
																				<li>Step 1: packet1 ----> router = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 2: packet2 ----> router and packet1 --->destination = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 3: packet3 ----> router and packet2 --->destination = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 4: packet3 ---> destination = L/R seconds</li>
																			</ul>
																			Total time: 4L/R seconds.

																		</p>

																		<p>Another important formula, relevance unclear: <br>
																				Where:
																				<ul>
																					<li> L = Bits</li>
																					<li> R = Rate (in bits/sec) </li>
																					<li> N = number of links each at rate R</li>

																				</ul>

																				The end-to-end delay = N*(L/R)<br>
																				<strong>d<sub>end-to-end</sub> = N (L/R)</strong>

															<h1>Queing Delays and Packet Loss</h1>
																							<p>Eech packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an <strong>output buffer</strong> (also called an <strong>output queue</strong>).</p>
																							<p><strong>Output Queue:</strong> Stores packets that are the router is about to send into the link that it refers to.</p>
																							<p> If a link is busy with the transmission of a packet, and another packet arrives there, it must wait in the output buffer. This is a <strong>queing delay.</strong>

																							If the finite buffer space is <strong> full</strong>, packet-loss will occur: either the arriving packet or one in the queue is <strong>dropped.</strong></p>

																<h1>Circuit Switching</h1>
																<p>In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path to provide for
																	 communication between the end systems are <strong>reserved</strong> for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.<br>
																	 In packet-switched networks, these resources are <strong>not</strong> reserved. The circuit-switched network is like a resturaunt that requires reservations,
																	and the packet-switched network is like one that doesn't: in the packet-switched network, you have to deal with queing delays and whatnot, but in the circuit-switched
																network you have to order in advanced. </p>

																<p> An example of a circuit switched network is a traditional telephone network. A connection (a <strong>circuit</strong> in telephony jargon) between two users must be established between the sender
																	and reciever, for which the switches on the path maintain connection state for that connection. The network reserves a constant transmission rate in the network's links
																	for the duration of the connection. Therefor the sender can transfer the data to the receiver at a <strong>gaurenteed</strong> constant rate.</p>
																	<p>A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing or time-division multiplexing.

																		<ul>
																			<li><strong>Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM):</strong>
																				For the duration of the connection, a link dedicates a frequency band to each connection. The width of the band is called the bandwidth. "the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link."</li>
																			<li><strong>Time-division multiplixing (TDM):</strong> Time is divided into frames of a fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots.
																			Across a link, a connection dedicates one timeslot per frame.</li>
																		</ul>

																		<p> Math: </p>
																		<p> For TDM, the transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot. Example: If a link trasmits 8,000 frames
																			per second and each slot consists of 8 bits, the transmission rate of a circuit is 64 kbps.</p>

																		<p> Another problem: We want to send a file of <strong>640,000 bits</strong> from Host A to Host B over a circuit-switched network, and all the links in the network use <strong>TDM with 24 slots</strong> and <strong>have a bit rate
																			of 1.563 Mbps</strong>, and it takes <strong> 500 msec</strong> to establish an end-to-end circuit before Host A can begin to transmit the file. How long does it take to send the file?



																		<ul>
																			<li>Step 1) Calculate transmission rate of a circuit (remember that the network dedicates just 1 timeslot per frame): (1.536 Mbps)/24 slots = 64 kbps (there are 1,000 kb in 1 mb)</li>
																				<li> Step 2) Divide the size of the file by the transmission rate: 640,000 bits/64 kbps = 10 seconds (there are 1000 bytes in 1 kb, so it's 640 k bits/ 64 k bitsPerSeconds = 10 secs)</li>
																					<li> Step 3) Add the 500 mscec = 1/2 seconds. So the total time is 10.5 seconds. <strong> The transmission time is indpendant of the number of links: it would be 10 seconds whether it were 1 or 100 links.</strong></li>
																			</ul>
																	</p>

																	<p>Another example: How long does it take to send a <strong>2.0 MiB</strong> file from Host A to Host B over a circuit-switched network, assuming:
																	<br>Total link transmission rate = <strong>26.4 Gbps</strong>.
																<br>	Network is TDM, with <strong>18.0</strong> permitted users, each with an equal time slot size.
																<br>	A link connection requires a setup time of <strong>90.8 ms</strong>.
																<br>	Your answer should be in miliseconds (ms):</p>
																<ul>
																	<li>Step 1) Calculate transmission rate of a circuit: (26.4 Gbps)/18 users = 26.4 billion/18 = 1.466... billion bps </li>
																		<li> Step 2) Divide the size of the file by the transmission rate: (2^20 * 8 * 2) bits / (26.4 billion/18) =  0.0114390 seconds = 11.4390109091 ms + 90.8 ms = 102.24 ms </li>
																	</ul>

																<p>Services like electonric mail, web surfing, social networks, instant messeging, video streaming, P2P file sharing, etc.
																are said to be <strong>distributed applications.</strong> This is because they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each
															other. Internet applications <strong>run on end systems--</strong> they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.

														Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, <strong>they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of the data.</strong> </p>

															<h1>ISPs</h1>

															<p>End systems access the Internet through <strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</strong>. </p>

															<p>Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide Internet access to both
															users and content-providers, connecting websites directly to the Internet.</p>

															<p>Lower-tier ISPs are connected through national and international
																upper-tier ISPs, such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT. An upper-tier ISP consists of a high-speed router
															interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.</p>

															<p>End-systems, packet-switches and more run <strong>protocols</strong> that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.</p>
															<p>Two important protocols:</p>
															<ul>
																	<li>The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)</strong></li>
																	<li>The <strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong> </li>
															</ul>

															<p>Together, these are known as TC/IP.</p>

															<p><strong>Internet Standards</strong> are developed by the <strong>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</strong>.
																The IETF standards documetns are called <strong>requests for comments (RFCs)</strong>. RFCs define protocols such as
																TCP, IP, HTTP (for web), and SMTP (for email). There are currently more than 6,000 RFCs.

															</p>

															<p>The IEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.</p>

																	<h1>Lecture 3a: Circuit-switching and Packet-switching</h1>

																	<p>1) A <span class="hidden">circuit</span>-switched network has a dedicated circuit through which information is
																	sent, whereas a <span class="hidden">packet</span>-switched network sends information in “chunks” through
																	a network on shared media</p>

																	<p>2) What units are we using for network bandwidth? <span class="hidden">bps</span></p>
																	<p>3) What units are used for transmission rate? <span class="hidden">bps</span></p>

																	<p>4) What is done with network resources in a circuit switched network to allow multiple
																		users to utilize the network?
																		<span class="hidden">	The network resource is divided into chunks</span>
																	</p>


																	<p>5) What is the difference between TDM and FDM</p>
																	<span class="hidden">	TDM divides the available bandwidth into discrete blocks of time, during which only one
																		of the users is permitted to transmit. FDM divides the available into bands of frequency
																		(like radio stations), in which only one user is permitted to transmit</span>

																	<p>6) How long does it take to send a 13 KiB file from Host A to Host B over a circuitswitched
																		network, assuming<br>
																		Total link transmission rate = 500Mbps<br>
																		The network is FDM, with 250 permitted users, each with an equal bandwidth share<br>
																		A link connection setup requires 100ms.</p>

																		<p class="hidden">

																		IMPORTANT: bps stands for <strong>bits</strong> per second, but KiB stands for Kiba<strong>byte</strong><br>

																		L (size in bits):<br>
																		 13 KiB = 13 x 1024 <strong>bytes</strong> = 13,312 bytes <br>
																		 13,312 bytes x 8 = <strong>106,496 bits.</strong><br>

																		 R (rate in bits per second):  500Mbps/250 users = 2 Mbps = 2,000,000 bps (<strong>Mega</strong> means <strong>Million</strong>)<br>

																		 106,496 bits/2,000,000 bitsps = 0.053248 seconds. <br>
																		 0.053248 x 1000 ms = 53.248 ms.
																		 53.248 ms + 100ms connection setup = <strong>153.248 ms.</strong>
																	 </p>


																		<p>7) What are three important functions of a packet-switched network?</p>
																		<span class="hidden"> Packet Construction, Transmission, and Interpretation</span>

																	<h1>Lecture 3b: Packet-switched vs. Circuit-switched networks</h1>

																	<p>1) Describe statistical multiplexing</p>
																	<span class="hidden">
																		Statistical multiplexing is the adaptive sharing of the transmission medium in packetswitched
																		networks, based on whether or not hosts have data to transmit (on-demand),
																		preventing the medium from being wasted by hosts without any data to transmit.
																	</span>

																	<p>2) Which are faster: Circuit-switched networks or Packet-switched networks?</p>
																	<span class="hidden">It depends! A circuit-switched network may be faster due to the packet header overhead
																		of packet-switched networks. However, a packet-switched network may be faster due to
																		its more adaptive use of the transmission medium. It’s even more complicated than this…</span>

																	<p>3) What is the total utilization of a circuit-switched network, accommodating 10 users with
																		equal bandwidth, with the following users:

																		<ul>
																			<li>Four users are utilizing 100% their bandwidth</li>
																			<li>Two users are utilizing 60% of their bandwidth</li>
																			<li>Four users are inactive</li>
																		</ul>
																		<span class="hidden">

																				Four users utilizing 100% of their bandwidth: 4 users * (1.00) using all of bandwidth * 0.10 = 0.4 + <br>
																				Two users utilizing 60%: 0.6 * 0.1 * 2 = 0.12 + <br>
																				Four users inactive: 0 (0 * 0.1 * 4) = <br>
																				0.52 = <strong>52%</strong>

																		</span>

																	</p>

																	<p>4) What are some of the effects of congestion in a packet-switched network?</p>
																	<span class="hidden">Packet delay, packet loss, jitter etc...</span>


																	<h1> Lecture 4: Network Structure and Performance</h1>

																	<p>1) What is an access network?</p>
																	<span class="hidden">A network that allows a host to connect to the internet</span>
																	<p>2) <span class="hidden">Throughput</span> is the rate at which bits are actually transferred between sender/receiver/p>
																	<p>3) Describe the sources of nodal delay in packet-switched networks.</p>

																	<span class="hidden">
																			<ul>
																				<li>Processing delay: Time spent processing header information, checking bit errors, and
																					deciding outport link</li>
																					<li>Queueing delay: Time waiting for the transmission medium</li>
																					<li>Transmission delay: Time spent being placed on the transmission medium, limited by the
																						transmission protocol.<br>
																						 Where <strong>R</strong>=link bandwidth (speed in bits per second, i.e. “bps”) and <strong>L</strong>=packet length (in bits),<br>
																					 <strong>Transmission Delay = L/R</strong></li>
																					<li>Propagation delay: Time spent traveling on the physical medium
																						<br>Where <strong>d</strong> = length of physical link (in <strong>meters</strong>) and
																						<strong>s</strong> = propogation speed in medium (~2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/sec):<br>
																						<strong>propogation delay = d/s</strong>			</li>


																				</ul>
																		</span>

																		<p>4) What is the equation for end-to-end delay?</p>
																		<span class="hidden">d<sub>nodal</sub> = d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>queue</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub>+ d<sub>prop</sub></span>

																			The hosts are separated physically by <strong>d</strong> meters along a cable for which the speed of

																		<h1>Bonus</h1>

																		REAL ONE: <br>
																		Time to translate and transdelay + propdleay = (360 / 2.1 million) + (502.4 * 1000)/(2.5 * 10^8) + (360/42,000) = 0.01075245714 seconds = 10.7524571429 ms. <br>

																		Subtract the time to create the first bit: 10.7524571429 - ((1/42000) * 1000) = 10.7286476199. Round to 10.73. <br>


																		<p>Suppose there are 79.0 packets entering a queue at the same time. Each packet is of size 7.0 MiB. The link transmission rate is 1.3 Gbps. What is the queueing delay of packet
																			number 44.0 (in milliseconds, rounded to one decimal place, e.g. 0.01234 seconds would be entered as "12.3")</p>

																			<span class="hidden">
																				<p>
																					L = (7 * 8 * 2^20) = 58720256 bits <br>
																					R = (1.3 billion) bits <br>
																					Transmission rate = ( (7 * 8 * 2^20) / 1.3 billion ) * 1000 = 45.1694276923 <br>
																					<strong>Important: Multiply by 43 instead of 44 because the first transmission has no delay</strong>:
